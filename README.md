1. Reduce Movement Amplification
In the updateHeadTracking function, change these lines:
javascript// Current (too sensitive):
const mappedX = (deltaX * maxTrackingDistance) * 2; // Amplify movement
const mappedY = -(deltaY * maxTrackingDistance) * 2; // Invert Y and amplify

// Change to:
const mappedX = (deltaX * maxTrackingDistance) * 0.5; // Reduce amplification
const mappedY = -(deltaY * maxTrackingDistance) * 0.5; // Reduce amplification


2. Increase Smoothing
Modify the smoothing factor:
javascript// Current:
const smoothingFactor = 0.15;

// Change to:
const smoothingFactor = 0.05; // More smoothing = less jittery movement


3. Reduce Camera Movement Scale
In the updateCameraPosition function:
javascript// Current:
const cameraX = x * 0.1; // Scale down movement
const cameraY = y * 0.1;

// Change to:
const cameraX = x * 0.03; // Further scale down
const cameraY = y * 0.03;


4. Reduce Off-Axis Projection Sensitivity
In the updateOffAxisProjection function:
javascript// Current:
const offsetScale = 0.005;

// Change to:
const offsetScale = 0.001; // Much less sensitive perspective shift


5. Optional: Add Dead Zone
You could also add a dead zone to ignore very small movements. Add this to updateHeadTracking:
javascript// Add after calculating deltaX and deltaY:
const deadZone = 0.01;
if (Math.abs(deltaX) < deadZone) deltaX = 0;
if (Math.abs(deltaY) < deadZone) deltaY = 0;
Start with changes #1 and #2 first - those will have the biggest impact on reducing sensitivity. Then fine-tune with the other adjustments as needed.
